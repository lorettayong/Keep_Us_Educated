# Introduction

As I had self-learnt how to use SQL and Tableau, I felt that it would be better if I could do a full-fledged proper report that requires application of both. The opportunity arose when I came across an Instagram advertisement by a brilliant online learning platform called [EntryLevel](https://www.entrylevel.net) and was attracted to their belief in gaining experience instead of a degree. And, I might add, it did no harm to learn from their programmes at no cost!

However, as I completed one mission after another and progressed on with the Data Analyst 2: SQL course, a sense of apprehension and fear of not being able to be a good data storyteller started to rise inside of me. At one point in time, it crossed my mind that I just might not be able to meet their programme requirements and, thus, would have to forfeit the downpayment I had made to enroll in the course. Maybe the latter was what motivated me to press on, make some assumptions about the case study and imagine that I am doing actual data analysis work... So I am glad to say that I managed to persevere on and submitted my portfolio ahead of the deadline.

The genesis of my portfolio was, of course, heavily influenced by the type of data that was used during the programme, which was related to charity donors and their donations. While EntryLevel had given us some guidelines on the report framework and even a well-designed report template, the main content of my portfolio was based entirely on my persona of someone who works in the Fundraising team of Keep Us Educated, a charity organisation from the fiction of my wildest of imaginations.

Attached would be the final version of my portfolio submission and reviews anonymously left by five of my programme peers (big thank yous to whoever you are!). We were instructed not to state personal details, such as name, email address and contact number, on the report so those have been suppressed accordingly.

Thank you for taking time to read this. :D
